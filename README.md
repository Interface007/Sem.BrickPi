C# library to interact with the hardware module BrickPi from mono.

This project will provide a C# library for interacting with the BrickPi - a hardware module to connect Lego Mindstorm sensors and motors to the Raspberry Pi.

Currently the communication with the serial interface is not running unter mono - this issue is under investigation.
